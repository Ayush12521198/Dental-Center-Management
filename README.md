⚙️ Technical Decisions

    Used localStorage to mock backend (for demo purposes)

    Used AuthContext for auth state and role-based routing

    Created reusable layout and input components

    Avoided Redux or backend to keep it frontend-only

🧠 Known Issues / Limitations

    No real authentication or database

    No pagination for long lists

    Files not persisted between sessions (only base64 in localStorage)

📈 Future Enhancements

    Firebase Auth or Express.js backend

    Export reports as PDF

    Email reminders for appointments

    Filtering and search for patients & treatments
